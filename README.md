- _.contains()
- _.every()
- _.some()
- _.shuffle()
- _.sortBy()
- _.zip()
- _.flatten()
- _.intersection()
- _.difference()
- _.invoke()

## Object methods:

## Function Decorators

- _.once()

**Some code may be written in ES6 and may require to be transpiled in order to be tested**.

Babeljs.io for transipiling.

Tests are made with the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
